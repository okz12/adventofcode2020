# Advent of Code 2020

### Christmas flavoured coding puzzles

See challenge descriptions here: https://adventofcode.com/2020

Code in Python 3.8 (I've used math.prod, walrus operators etc. on some days).

---

### Post-Completion

Completed 25/25 (also hit day 25 leaderboard with position #850).

What I loved:

Good spread of problems with no interconnectivity (debugging intcode every other day during AoC2019 was draining).

What I hated:

Being stuck on [13](./13/) for an hour trying to compute a modulus with remainder efficiently before finding out about [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem).

What I learnt:

New Python 3.8 features which I typically avoid for backward compatibility, better type hinting, dataclasses and practicing regex. The coolest trick I learnt was using complex numbers for 2D grid location (see days [12](./12/) and [24](./24/)). This significantly improved my code as coordinates could be summed, multiplied and rotated using a built-in type with its operators.
